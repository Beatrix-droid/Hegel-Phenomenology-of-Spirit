# Hegel-Phenomenology-of-Spirit

This is a Neural Network that is trained to write Hegelian philosophy. It has been trained on 
Hegel's most influential work, the "Phenomenology Of Spirit G W F Hegel" which one can read here: 

https://archive.org/details/phenomenology-of-spirit-g-w-f-hegel/page/n7/mode/2up

a copy of this book is also downloadable as a txt file in that same link. 

The Hegel.txt file present in this repository is a processed version of the book, where the table of contents, editor's notes, forwards, and editor's introduction have been removed, so that the model would exclusively be exposed to Hegel and ony Hegel's writing.

The code of this project is a combination and an adaptation of the code found here: 
https://amysfernweh.wordpress.com/2020/10/28/pythonmachine-learning-neural-network-shakespeare-or-fakespeare-that-is-the-question/ and the code found in this tensorflow tutorial: https://www.tensorflow.org/text/tutorials/text_generation . 

In both of these works the aim was to create a Neural Network that would generate shakespearean text.
